pagePersoRustWebsite_title = This website
pagePersoRustWebsite_desc = This is this website, made with <a href="https://leptos.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">leptos</a> and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">rust</a>
 <br/></br>
 Thanks to leptos, the whole site (front and back) is made in rust.
 I use <a href="https://www.docker.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Docker</a> for the <b>deployment</b> part, <a href="https://caddyserver.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Caddy</a> for the <b>proxy/ssl</b> part.
 The <b>translation</b> part uses <a href="https://projectfluent.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fluent</a>.

 It replaces my old site made with

pagePersoHtrace_desc = A simple trace class, made in rust, based on Hconfig.
pagePersoHArcMut_desc = A data synchronization class with cache between threads, made in rust.<br/>
                        Places the data in a RwLock shared between threads and a local copy of the data (in each thread) which will make a synchronization attempt during a get().<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Uses <a href="https://crates.io/crates/parking_lot" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Parking_lot</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/arc-swap" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Arc-swap</a>
pagePersoHconfig_desc = A JSON file configuration management class, made in rust.
pagePersoSingletonThread_desc = Allows the use of a FnMut function as a singleton via a dedicated thread, made in rust.
pagePersoHwe_desc = It was simply a set of PHP classes that I used a lot, notably Hyultis\loader which allows me,
 unlike composer,
 to load classes dynamically during development (without all the overlay of a symfony for example), as well as to avoid PSR standards.<br/>
 My old site, as well as professional projects were made on it (or on an equivalent basis).
 <br/>
 The default project structure (configurable in phpEntry.php)<br/>
 <ul>
  <li>root<ul>
   <li>a configuration folder ("config" by default)</li>
   <li>a dynamic folder (cache, trace, user file, etc: "dynamic" by default)</li>
   <li>a source folder ("src" by default)</li>
   <li>a library folder ("vendors" by default)</li>
   <li>phpEntry.php: the entry file</li>
   </ul><li>
 </ul>
 The input file is the heart of the system, any real entry point (console command, apache|nginx vhost, etc.) thus knows everything about the project (root path, configuration, etc.)<br/>
 I also used an agnostic external library system, allowing to use several at once (Example: Composer, npm, but also a personal "Hloader").<br/>
 <br/>
 Before Hwe, I used a another homemade project "Hcms", which is no longer relevant today.

pagePersoCasseBrique_desc = Brick Breaker made in HTML5 was born following the desire to test the new features included in HTML5, in particular the &lt;canvas&gt; tag.
pagePersoCasseBrique_title = Brick Breaker
pagePersoVidPHPConverter_desc = Audio and video utility in php through <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">FFMpeg</a>.<br/>
 <br/>
 This script makes it possible to read the information of a multimedia file (audio or video), thus allowing to know various information: duration, bitrate, codec, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
 It also allows video and audio conversion, audio extraction, to the formats supported by FFMpeg.<br/>
 <br/>
 A basic "streaming" through the HTTP protocol is possible, and thus allows a VOD system (video on demand) from any format.

pagePersoWowMyStats_desc = Mini-site of statistics on characters of world of warcraft.<br/>
 <br/>
 The system parsed the xml of the armory online of WOW to recover the information of a character, then did it regularly to make statistics of evolution.<br/>
 It also allowed to generate images to put in the signatures of forums.<br/>
 <br/>
 But between the evolution of the armory of wow and my disinterest of the game, this system does not work anymore.
